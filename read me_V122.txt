last frame was not printing until version 121, 

V122 fixed, now can print last frame

SyncStack.cpp  , 
made below changes in both LoadArenaFromDAT and LoadRoomFromDAT function

//if ( firstFrame && secondFrame && isEOF != EOF )

//Jaini :: 11/24/15 :: If you keep the condition as above, 
//it doesn't write out last frame value. 
//To write last frame value use below condition. 

if ( firstFrame && secondFrame )
